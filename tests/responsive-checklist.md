# Responsive Checklist

Use **device-testing.html** to verify that the dashboard adapts well to different screen sizes.

- [ ] Open `tests/device-testing.html` in a modern browser.
- [ ] Resize the window to simulate mobile (≈375px), tablet (≈768px) and desktop (≥1280px) widths.
- [ ] Ensure menus, charts and text remain readable without horizontal scrolling.
- [ ] Check that important elements do not overlap or break at any size.
- [ ] Note the viewport dimensions shown in the overlay during each check.
